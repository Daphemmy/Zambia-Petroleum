        and Oil (now Oando) in the mid-1990s and an upward trajectory through
        roles in MRS Oil and banking Peters launched Sigmund Communecci in
        1999—Aiteo’s precursor—which evolved into a fully integrated energy
        powerhouse by 2008 . Now, in 2025, the reformation of this legacy into
        Zambis Petroleum Limited aims to consolidate lessons learned and forge a
